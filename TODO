Possible ways to enhance the results:

* Output results sub-sectioned by words with the most unique characters.

* Categorise words based on popularity.
  * I may need to write a tool to generate such an index.

* Add an option to test characters with a known-bad submission. ie.
  For when where there are too many possible answers, add a switch to narrow
  results down by submission of a word that's known to be invalid. eg. _olar
  might start with m, p, s or v which may require 4 additional attempts, so
  finding a 5 character word with most of those possible characters might be
  faster.

* Automatically fetch and install a missing dictionary.

* Does not factor into the possibility of a character being used multiple
  times, but a guess only eliminiating one of them. eg. if the answer is
  "robot" but "enjoy" was guessed, only the second "o" will be revealed.
